This directory is supposed to hold all database/external functions that is written so that 
we can import these functions in app.py without having to write all these functions in app.py.
app.py should be just routes and routing code, and all the custom functions should be written in
this directory and imported. In addition, I was taught that creating an "__init__.py" file is mandatory
to have this directory work
